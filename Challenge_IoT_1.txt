Project: IoT Smoke Detector

Description:
This project involves building a smoke detector that can send notifications to your smartphone or trigger an alarm when smoke is detected. You will be able to monitor your home for potential fire hazards remotely.

Components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano)
Smoke sensor module (e.g., MQ-2 sensor)
Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
Buzzer or alarm module
LED module
Jumper wires
Power supply (e.g., USB cable and adapter)
Steps:

Set up the Arduino board and connect the Wi-Fi module to it. Make sure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed for programming the Wi-Fi module.

Connect the smoke sensor module to the Arduino. Use jumper wires to connect the following:

Smoke sensor module VCC pin to Arduino 5V pin
Smoke sensor module GND pin to Arduino GND pin
Smoke sensor module digital output pin to an Arduino digital input pin
Connect the buzzer or alarm module to the Arduino. Use jumper wires to connect the following:

Buzzer or alarm module positive pin to an Arduino digital output pin
Buzzer or alarm module negative pin to Arduino GND pin
Connect the LED module to the Arduino. Use jumper wires to connect the following:

LED module positive pin to an Arduino digital output pin
LED module negative pin to Arduino GND pin
Write the Arduino code to read the smoke sensor module's digital output and perform the following actions:

If smoke is detected, send a notification to your smartphone using the Wi-Fi module and IoT platform or service.
Activate the alarm module (buzzer) and LED module to indicate the presence of smoke.
Set up an IoT platform or cloud service. You can use platforms like Blynk, Adafruit IO, or ThingSpeak. Follow the platform's documentation to create an account, create a project, and obtain the necessary credentials for your Arduino and smartphone app.

Create a mobile app using the IoT platform's tools or APIs. Design the app to receive notifications and display the smoke status. Connect the mobile app to the IoT platform using your account credentials.

Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino board and connect it to power.

Install the mobile app on your smartphone and connect it to the IoT platform using your account credentials.

Place the smoke sensor in a suitable location in your home.

When smoke is detected, the Arduino will send a notification to your smartphone through the IoT platform, and the alarm (buzzer) and LED will be activated to alert you about the potential fire hazard.

Remember to follow safety precautions while working with smoke or fire-related projects. Place the smoke sensor in appropriate locations and test the system regularly to ensure its proper functioning.

This IoT smoke detector project allows you to remotely monitor your home for potential fire hazards and receive real-time notifications on your smartphone. You can further enhance the project by adding features like integrating with home automation systems, configuring emergency contacts, or incorporating additional sensors for environmental monitoring.
